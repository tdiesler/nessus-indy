# Nessus Indy

With Nessus Indy we explore aspects of digital identy and verifiable credentials.

This is a contribution to "Making The World Work Better For All".

Who is going to control our digitial identity? Digital forms of our birth certificate, passport, drivers license,
medical records, vaccination certificates, univeristy degrees, property certificates, etc.
Is it the state, a corporation or should we be in control ourselves?

Shouldn't we have in fact a [self sovereign identity](https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity) (SSI)?
