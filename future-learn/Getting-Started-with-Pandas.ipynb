    "## Introduction to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is considered to be one of the most favorite Python libraries to work with. Perhaps because it is the workhorse for data analysts using Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas = Panel + Data \n",
    "    \n",
    "Etymologically, Pandas is a portmanteau from ‘Panel’ and ‘Data’. Panel data is a term commonly used for the data sets that contain data with observations over a period of time for the same subject / individuals each time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Pandas functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many Pandas functionalities that include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- loading your data from a file to start your analysis\n",
    "- previewing your data to understand the data\n",
    "- manipulating your data for gathering better insights \n",
    "- transforming your data from one format to another\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As in Python, to use a module in your Pandas program you first need to import it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Pandas\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "NumPy is powerful, but it lacks some high-level functions and abstractions that are needed for solving everyday problems for a data analyst using structured data tables. \n",
